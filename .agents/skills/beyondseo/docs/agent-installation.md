# Install BeyondSEO in your assistant

Choose the app you actually use. **Claude on the web, Claude Code and ChatGPT Work have different installation steps.** BeyondSEO contains the complete SEO workflow, backlink library and native crawler; no scraping-service account or SEO API key is required. Your assistant's normal model usage still applies.

| Your app | Start here |
|---|---|
| ChatGPT Work | [Ask Work to install it](#chatgpt-work) |
| Claude website / desktop / Cowork | [Upload the skill bundle](#claude-website-and-desktop-skills) |
| Claude Code | [One local installation command](#claude-code) |
| Codex | [One local installation command](#codex) |
| Hermes Agent | [Choose your active profile](#hermes-agent) |
| OpenClaw | [Choose your agent's workspace](#openclaw) |
| Another assistant | [Check its capabilities](#other-assistants) |

## Easiest start: paste the GitHub URL

In Work, Cowork or a local coding assistant with installation tools, paste:

```text
Install BeyondSEO from https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo in the
assistant I am using. Follow docs/agent-installation.md for this host.
Use the complete skill bundle, register it through this app's supported
skill controls, and confirm it appears in my Skills list.
Set up the native crawler in a permitted execution environment and run
doctor. Report skill registration, HTTP readiness and browser readiness
separately. If a step fails, show the exact error and resolve that step.

```

This asks the assistant to do the setup for you. It can use its supported importer or download the complete bundle and follow the matching steps below. Confirm that the skill is actually saved; reading a GitHub page alone does not install it. If the app offers manual uploads, use the ready-made ZIP. You do not need to install another SEO plugin.

## ChatGPT Work

### Upload the bundle directly

1. Get the named skill ZIP from the release, when available, or use **Prepare the upload from source** below.
2. Open **Customize → Skills → Create → Upload from your computer**.
3. Choose `beyondseo-<version>-skill.zip`. Wait for BeyondSEO to appear in the Skills list, then open it and confirm the supporting files are present.
4. Choose **Try in chat**, use the **Work** surface, and ask it to run the installation check below. A saved skill and a working crawler are separate results.

These controls were exercised in the ChatGPT web interface. Labels and availability can vary by account. Use the native file chooser for a manual upload; no browser extension is needed. An automated browser's file-upload permission error is separate from the skill's save or safety-scan result.

### Ask Work to install from GitHub

Alternatively, paste this into Work:

```text
Install BeyondSEO from https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo as a reusable
Work skill. Read docs/agent-installation.md and docs/permissions.md first.
Use the complete beyondseo/ skill bundle, including its Python source,
scripts, playbooks and backlink catalog. Use the workspace's supported
skill-save tools and confirm it appears in my Skills list.

Then set up the crawler in this Work execution environment. If the skill
folder cannot host executable files, use scripts/setup.py --venv with a
host-approved writable execution folder and scripts/run.py --runtime
with the same folder. Run doctor. Report skill registration, HTTP readiness
and browser readiness separately. If a step fails, show its exact error
and investigate that step; a format check alone is not installation success.
```

Work needs access to all bundled files and its supported skill-save controls. A GitHub URL provides a source to import; it is not itself an installation endpoint. After saving, find BeyondSEO in the skill picker and select it with `@` where available. Open a fresh task and ask it to read the bundled backlink catalog to confirm the resources were retained.

OpenAI distinguishes workspace skills from local filesystem skills. A copy on your computer does not register a cloud Work skill. Use the installation controls available in your workspace; a normal chat attachment may only make the files available to that conversation. [Skill authoring](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) · [Workspace and local controls](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/skills).

### When Work cannot save or run it

| Error | What the assistant should do |
|---|---|
| HTTP 422 during save | Capture the response body, failing operation and submitted file list. Check the skill name, description, complete folder layout and supported file requirements. A 422 alone does not identify a safety finding. |
| An explicit safety-scan rejection | Read the flagged file/rule, explain the finding and correct the actual issue. Use workspace support if the reason is unavailable. Keep scanning and approval controls enabled. |
| Permission denied launching Python | Identify which path was denied. Use an execution folder supported by that Work environment with `--venv`; do not place a virtualenv inside a read-only or non-executable skill mount. |
| Saved skill, missing bundled files | Re-import the complete bundle through the supported workflow and verify a playbook, the catalog and `src/beyondseo/cli.py` are accessible. |
| Browser cannot launch | Inspect `doctor`; install Chromium/system libraries only where the host permits them. HTTP mode can read initial HTML, but does not establish JavaScript coverage. |

The package validator does not call Work's save service or safety scanner. There is no BeyondSEO switch that grants workspace permissions or guarantees acceptance. Keep a failed save separate from a failed runtime setup; correcting one does not prove the other is resolved.

## Claude website and desktop Skills

This route also covers Claude Cowork through its Skills controls.

1. Use the matching `beyondseo-<version>-skill.zip` from the [release assets](https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo/releases/latest), if offered. If the release provides source only, use **Prepare the upload from source** below. GitHub’s automatic source ZIP is not a direct skill upload; its enclosing folder has a different name.
2. Enable **Code execution and file creation** in Claude's capabilities if it is available to your account.
3. Open **Customize → Skills → Add skill → Upload skill**, then select the ZIP. Some versions label this **+ → Create skill → Upload a skill**.
4. Enable BeyondSEO in the skill list. Start a new chat and ask: “Use BeyondSEO to explain what you can do and check whether your crawler is ready.”

The archive contains one `beyondseo/` folder, matching `name: beyondseo`, with `SKILL.md` and every runtime resource. Its description is under Claude.ai's documented 200-character limit. The builder also checks a maximum of 200 archive files, including its receipt: Claude Desktop rejected a larger bundle at save time. Reporting and industry guidance is indexed in two consolidated files to stay within this limit without removing capabilities. Creating an account or entering hosting credentials is unnecessary for installation. Organization permissions can affect whether uploads are available. [Create a custom skill](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills) · [Use skills in Claude](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-use-skills-in-claude).

If the upload says **“Zip contains too many files (maximum 200)”**, use a bundle built from version 2.7.1 or later. Do not upload the GitHub source archive, remove arbitrary runtime files, or disable the scan. This observed package-limit error does not establish the cause of a different host's unexplained HTTP 422.

Saving the skill does not install Python packages. Ask Claude to follow [crawler setup](#crawler-setup-in-a-hosted-environment) using its available execution environment. The Claude API and Claude Code have separate runtime and installation rules.

### Prepare the upload from source

Download and extract the [complete source](https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Open a terminal in the extracted `beyondseo-main` folder containing `SKILL.md` and `scripts`. Run:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_skill.py --out ../beyondseo-skill.zip
```

On Windows, use `py -3` instead of `python3`. The builder needs Python 3.10+ but no crawler dependencies, Git or API key. Upload the resulting `beyondseo-skill.zip` using steps 2–4 above. An assistant with file and shell tools can perform this preparation for you. Keep the ZIP and its checksum outside the source folder.

The normal setup also installs the free report renderer. After setup, use `present` for [branded PDF/HTML reports](branded-reports.md). PDF export itself needs no browser or search access; HTML remains available if PDF rendering is unavailable.

## Local assistants: get the folder once

**Without Git:** download the [complete source ZIP](https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it, and open a terminal in `beyondseo-main`. A named skill ZIP, when offered, extracts as `beyondseo` instead. This works when Windows says Git is missing. Confirm that you can see `SKILL.md` and `scripts` directly inside that folder.

**With Git:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo.git
cd beyondseo
```

Run just the command for your assistant below. It copies the complete skill and prepares the crawler. Python **3.10+** is required; **3.12** is recommended. On Windows PowerShell replace `python3` with `py -3`. Activation and execution-policy changes are unnecessary.

After setup, the launcher hands off to the installed runtime before checking the engine's Python requirement. This allows an older default `python3` to start an already prepared compatible runtime; it does not make the engine compatible with old Python. If no compatible runtime exists, run setup with Python 3.10+.

## Claude Code

```sh
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --host claude-code --setup
```

The personal location is `~/.claude/skills/beyondseo`. To install only for a project, add `--workspace "/path/to/project"`. Start a new Claude Code session, then use:

```text
/beyondseo Audit https://example.com and give me a practical improvement plan.
```

[Claude Code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

## Codex

```sh
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --host codex --setup
```

The personal location is `~/.agents/skills/beyondseo`. Add `--workspace "/path/to/project"` for project scope. Select BeyondSEO in the skill list; CLI and IDE users can invoke `$beyondseo`. If it is not listed, refresh or open a new session. [Official skill guidance](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills).

## Hermes Agent

```sh
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --host hermes --setup
```

The helper uses `HERMES_HOME` when set. Otherwise it uses `~/.hermes` on macOS/Linux or `%LOCALAPPDATA%/hermes` on native Windows. If a named profile is active but its path is unavailable, the helper asks for that exact location instead of silently installing into the default profile:

```sh
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --host hermes --profile-home "/path/to/active-profile" --setup
```

Start a new Hermes session and ask it to list skills, then invoke `/beyondseo`. Check its active profile if the skill is missing. Remote or container terminals need the same source files and a runtime prepared there.

Hermes' URL importer may fetch only directly referenced resources on some versions. Use the complete folder workflow here so the Python package and nested catalog are retained. Hermes has its own skill scanner; review actual findings and keep its policy enabled. [Hermes skills](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/skills/) · [Native Windows guidance](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/windows-native).

## OpenClaw

For one agent, use its actual workspace:

```sh
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --host openclaw --workspace "/path/to/agent-workspace" --setup
```

For a shared installation under the current state directory:

```sh
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --host openclaw --setup
```

Shared installation uses `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/skills/beyondseo`, or `~/.openclaw/skills/beyondseo` with the default state. Confirm discovery with `openclaw skills list` and `openclaw skills check`, then ask that agent to use BeyondSEO.

A sandboxed agent needs Python and optional Chromium **inside its execution environment**, even if they work on the Gateway host. Ask the administrator to provide those capabilities through the supported sandbox setup. BeyondSEO is distributed through this repository; these instructions do not assume a ClawHub listing. [OpenClaw skills](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/skills) · [Skill configuration](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/skills-config).

## Crawler setup in a hosted environment

The assistant should identify an approved writable/executable runtime directory. The paths below are placeholders that it must replace with actual paths from its environment:

```sh
python3 "/path/to/beyondseo/scripts/setup.py" --venv "/approved/runtime/beyondseo"
python3 "/path/to/beyondseo/scripts/run.py" --runtime "/approved/runtime/beyondseo" doctor
```

External setup builds from a temporary source copy in the selected runtime directory. It does not write build files into the original skill mount. Use the same `--runtime` when crawling. If the environment cannot execute Python or download dependencies, that remains a host capability limitation; moving files arbitrarily or changing security controls is not a supported fix.

For a normal writable local skill folder, `python3 scripts/setup.py` uses its own `.venv`. Add `--http-only` to setup to skip Chromium. With the local installer use `--setup --http-only`. [Detailed runtime troubleshooting](setup.md).

## Know when installation is complete

Ask your assistant:

```text
Check my BeyondSEO installation. Can you find the skill in this host's
Skills list, read its bundled backlink catalog, and run its native doctor?
Report each result separately. Then crawl https://example.com with a
maximum of two pages and save the evidence outside the skill folder.
Tell me whether HTTP and JavaScript rendering actually worked.
```

There are three separate results: **skill registered**, **HTTP ready**, and **browser ready**. A successful command does not prove every requested page was read; inspect the crawl's saved coverage and errors. In HTTP-only mode a missing browser is expected and `doctor` returns a nonzero status.

## Updates and existing installations

Running the same local install again is safe: an identical installation is reported as already installed. After obtaining a newer source folder, add `--update` to the original command. The helper verifies the previous receipt, preserves the old folder under `beyondseo-backups` outside the host's skill discovery folder, and installs a fresh copy. An existing local `.venv` directory is copied back to its original absolute path so an update does not remove a working runtime; the backup remains intact. External or symlinked runtime directories are not copied. Changed skill files are preserved and require review before replacement. Add `--setup` to install or refresh dependencies, then run doctor; preserving a runtime is not proof that it satisfies new dependencies.

Use `--dry-run` to preview without writing or downloading anything. Use `--dest "/exact/path/beyondseo"` for a custom skill location. This is a filesystem installer; it does not save a ChatGPT workspace skill or change host settings. For web uploads, use the host's supported update controls and avoid leaving two enabled versions.

## Other assistants

A host that reads the Agent Skills format can load the workflow. Full native crawling additionally requires accessible source files, Python 3.10+, permitted network access and, for rendered pages, Chromium execution. Register the complete folder using that host's documented controls, then run the checks above. Compatibility with the format is not a promise of every agent's save permissions, tools or operating environment.

## Package review and support

Read [what the package does and accesses](permissions.md). `python3 scripts/validate_skill.py` checks the description, required resources and bundled links without network access. It does not certify a host's safety decision.

For an installation issue, include the app name, version, operating system or cloud environment, whether saving or execution failed, and the exact redacted error. Do not include passwords, keys or private client reports. [Report an installation issue](https://github.com/beyondtahir/beyondseo/issues/new?template=installation.yml).

## Search and browser readiness after installation

Run `beyondseo doctor` in the actual task runtime. Reuse an available host browser when appropriate; `beyondseo browser-setup` checks first and installs missing free local Chromium components only when requested. See [browser-assisted Google search](browser-search.md) and [diagnostics by environment](discovery-diagnostics.md). Installing a skill does not itself grant browser control or network permission.

## Check model access separately

Before blaming BeyondSEO for an agent that cannot start, try one short model response without tools. A saved sign-in indicator does not prove the next request will succeed. For example, if Claude Code's actual response says its OAuth token expired, run `claude auth login` and complete sign-in; reinstalling BeyondSEO or Chromium does not repair that login. Keep authentication failures separate from website or search-provider failures.

Hermes can use an already configured subscription or local model. OpenClaw can use a supported subscription login or local Ollama model. These are host choices, not dependencies required by BeyondSEO. Test that the chosen model can call tools and read evidence; a successful text-only reply does not establish a completed audit. Do not copy credential files between agents. Use each host's supported sign-in flow when needed.

When installing OpenClaw itself, check the selected release's Node requirement before installation. BeyondSEO's Python requirement is separate. Follow [OpenClaw installation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/install) and [local Ollama setup](https://docs.openclaw.ai/providers/ollama/setup); retain existing host configuration unless a particular change is needed and authorized.
